🚀 Launching CIPWE - The Web Vitals for the AI Web

After months of building, I'm excited to release CIPWE (pronounced "sip-we"), a command-line tool that makes your website visible in AI answers.

**Why this matters:**
AI agents like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude are becoming primary discovery channels. If your site isn't optimized for machine parsing, you're invisible in AI answers.

**What CIPWE does:**
✅ Scores your site across 20 rules covering structured data, semantic HTML, metadata, and agent signals
✅ Generates fix files (JSON-LD, llms.txt, robots.txt, sitemap) instantly
✅ Works in CI/CD pipelines with JSON output and quality gates
✅ Zero setup - just run with npx

**Quick start:**
```
npx cipwe audit https://your-site.com
```

**Built for:**
- Growth teams tracking answer-engine visibility
- Engineering teams adding AI-readiness to quality gates
- Content teams validating machine-readable structure

CIPWE is open-source, production-ready, and available on npm today.

📦 NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cipwe
